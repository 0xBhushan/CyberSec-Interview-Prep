| Vulnerability Category                                   | Description                                                                                           | Impact                                                                                              | Mitigation                                                                                                             |
|--------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **1. Broken Access Control**                            | Flaws in access control allowing unauthorized users to gain access to restricted functions or data. | Unauthorized access to sensitive information or functionality.                                     | Implement role-based access controls, enforce the principle of least privilege, and validate user permissions.       |
| **2. Cryptographic Failures**                          | Inadequate protection of sensitive data using cryptographic methods, leading to data exposure.       | Exposure of sensitive data such as passwords and credit card information.                           | Use strong encryption algorithms, ensure proper key management, and encrypt data at rest and in transit.              |
| **3. Injection**                                       | Occurs when untrusted data is sent to an interpreter as part of a command or query.                 | Can allow attackers to execute arbitrary commands, access data, or compromise the server.          | Use parameterized queries, prepared statements, and input validation.                                               |
| **4. Insecure Design**                                 | Flaws in the application design that expose it to various attacks.                                  | Increases risk of exploitation through design vulnerabilities.                                       | Adopt secure design principles, perform threat modeling, and review application architecture for security flaws.     |
| **5. Security Misconfiguration**                        | Poorly configured security settings on servers, databases, or applications.                          | Can lead to unauthorized access and data exposure.                                                 | Establish a secure configuration baseline, regularly review and update configurations, and automate management.       |
| **6. Vulnerable and Outdated Components**              | Use of outdated libraries and components that contain known vulnerabilities.                         | Exploitability of known vulnerabilities leading to data breaches.                                  | Regularly update and patch components, use automated tools for vulnerability scanning, and maintain an inventory of dependencies. |
| **7. Identification and Authentication Failures**      | Issues with user authentication processes, such as weak passwords or session management flaws.       | Can allow unauthorized access and account compromise.                                              | Implement strong password policies, use multi-factor authentication, and secure session management practices.         |
| **8. Software and Data Integrity Failures**            | Issues that allow the alteration of software or data without detection.                              | Compromised integrity can lead to unauthorized code execution and data manipulation.                | Implement integrity checks, use secure coding practices, and validate all inputs.                                   |
| **9. Security Logging and Monitoring Failures**        | Insufficient logging and monitoring can hinder the detection of security incidents.                  | Delays in incident response and prolonged exploitation of vulnerabilities.                          | Implement comprehensive logging, establish alerting for suspicious activity, and regularly review logs for anomalies. |
| **10. Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)**            | Occurs when an attacker can make the server send requests to internal or external resources.        | Can lead to exposure of sensitive internal systems and data.                                        | Validate and sanitize user input, restrict outgoing network traffic, and implement a firewall to block untrusted requests. |
